   abstract = {Regular correspondences between historically related
                  languages can be modelled using finitestate
                  transducers (FST). A new method is presented by
                  demonstrating it with a bidirectional experiment
                  between Finnish and Estonian. An artificial
                  representation (resembling a protolanguage) is
                  established between two related languages. This
                  representation; AFE (Aligned Finnish-Estonian) is
                  based on the letter by letter alignment of the two
                  languages and uses mechanically constructed
                  morphophonemes which represent the corresponding
                  characters. By describing the constraints of this
                  AFE using two-level rules; one may construct useful
                  mappings between the languages. In this way; the
                  badly ambiguous FSTs from Finnish and Estonian to
                  AFE can be composed into a practically unambiguous
                  transducer from Finnish to Estonian. The inverse
                  mapping from Estonian to Finnish is mildly
                  ambiguous. Steps according to the proposed method
                  could be repeated as such with dialectal or older
                  written texts. Choosing a set of model words;
                  aligning them; recording the mechanical
                  correspondences and designing rules for the
                  constraints could be done with a limited effort. For
                  the purposes of indexing and searching; the mild
                  ambiguity may be tolerable as such. The ambiguity
                  can be further reduced by composing the resulting
                  FST with a speller or morphological analyser of the
                  standard language.}
